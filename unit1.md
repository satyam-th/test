## 1. Data Structures

* **What are they?**
    * A data structure is a specific way to collect, organize, and store data in a computer to perform operations effectively[cite: 3].
    * It defines the relationship between data elements and the operations that can be performed on that data[cite: 4, 10].
    * Formally, a data structure (D) can be seen as a combination of a set of domains (d), a set of functions (F) operating on those domains, and a set of rules (A) governing these operations: $D=\{d,F,A\}$[cite: 5].
* **Why are they important?**
    * They allow programmers to store and manipulate data efficiently[cite: 10].
    * They help understand relationships between data elements[cite: 10].
    * They govern the types and efficiency of operations on data[cite: 10].
* **Common Examples:** Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Heaps, Graphs[cite: 9].

* **Classification of Data Structures** [cite: 11, 12]

    ```

    * **Primitive Data Structures:**
        * Predefined ways of storing data by the system (e.g., `int`, `float`, `char`, `double`)[cite: 13, 15].
        * Operations on them are also predefined[cite: 14].
        * Directly operated upon by machine-level instructions[cite: 15].
    * **Non-Primitive Data Structures:**
        * More complex structures derived from primitive data structures[cite: 17, 18].
        * Focus on structuring groups of homogeneous or heterogeneous data items[cite: 19].
        * **Linear Data Structures:** Elements maintain a linear relationship (e.g., arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues)[cite: 21, 12]. Data is arranged linearly, though not necessarily sequentially in memory[cite: 21, 22].
        * **Non-Linear Data Structures:** Data elements don't have a sequential arrangement; instead, they have a hierarchical relationship (e.g., trees, graphs)[cite: 21, 12]. Insertion and deletion are not linear[cite: 21].

## 2. Abstract Data Type (ADT)

* **What is it?**
    * An ADT is a logical description or a mathematical model for a data type where behavior is defined by a set of values and a set of operations[cite: 23, 28].
    * It defines a set of values and a set of operations on those values[cite: 23, 29].
    * Crucially, an ADT specifies *what* operations are to be performed but *not how* they will be implemented[cite: 24, 25]. It's a theoretical concept[cite: 27].
    * Example: A Stack ADT is defined by operations like `push`, `pop`, and `peek`, regardless of how these are coded[cite: 30, 31].
    * Primitive data types can be considered a form of ADT provided by the language[cite: 32, 33].

## 3. Algorithms

* **What is an algorithm?**
    * A precise sequence of instructions to be carried out in order to solve a given problem[cite: 37]. Each instruction specifies a task[cite: 38].
* **Properties of Algorithms**[cite: 40, 41, 42, 43]:
    * **Input:** Takes zero or more quantities as input[cite: 40].
    * **Output:** Produces at least one output[cite: 43].
    * **Definiteness:** Each step must be clear and unambiguous[cite: 43].
    * **Finiteness:** Must terminate after a finite number of steps or time[cite: 42].
    * **Effectiveness:** Each step must be executable in finite time[cite: 41].
    * **Correctness:** Must produce the correct output for each set of inputs[cite: 43].
* **Types of Algorithms (Examples):** Simple Recursive algorithms, Dynamic programming algorithm, Backtracking algorithm, Divide and conquer algorithm, Greedy algorithm, Brute Force algorithm, Randomized algorithm[cite: 46].

* **Algorithm Design Approaches**[cite: 52]:
    * **Incremental Approach**[cite: 54]:
        * The solution is built step-by-step, adding new features or solving small sub-problems at each stage[cite: 54].
        * Start with a base case and expand, maintaining correctness after each step[cite: 55, 56, 57].
        * Example: Insertion Sort (inserting one element at a time into the correct position)[cite: 55].
    * **Divide and Conquer**[cite: 58]:
        * The problem is divided into smaller, independent sub-problems[cite: 58].
        * Each sub-problem is solved (often recursively)[cite: 59].
        * Their solutions are combined to solve the original problem[cite: 59].
        * Examples: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search[cite: 60].

## 4. Algorithm Analysis

* **Why analyze algorithms?** [cite: 47, 48, 49, 50, 51]
    * To evaluate efficiency based on time and memory[cite: 47].
    * To compare different algorithms for the same problem[cite: 50].
    * To predict performance for large inputs and understand scalability[cite: 49, 50].
    * To identify performance bottlenecks[cite: 51].
* **Performance Measures**[cite: 62]:
    * **Time Complexity:** Quantifies the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of input length[cite: 63]. It's often measured by the number of statement executions rather than actual clock time[cite: 63].
    * **Space Complexity:** The amount of memory space an algorithm requires during execution[cite: 65]. Important for multi-user systems or limited memory scenarios[cite: 66].

## 5. Asymptotic Notations

* **What are they?**
    * Standard notations used to describe an algorithm's running time (or space) behavior as the input size increases, focusing on its growth rate[cite: 67, 68, 69].
    * Asymptotic analysis is typically input-bound; if there's no input, an algorithm often works in constant time[cite: 70].
* **Types**[cite: 71]:

    * **Big-O Notation ($O$):**
        * Expresses the **upper bound** of an algorithm's running time; it measures the **worst-case time complexity** or the longest time an algorithm might take[cite: 72, 73, 74].
        * Definition: $f(n) = O(g(n))$ if there exist positive constants $c$ and $n_0$ such that $0 \le f(n) \le cg(n)$ for all $n \ge n_0$[cite: 75]. This means $f(n)$ does not grow faster than $g(n)$ beyond a certain input size $n_0$[cite: 75, 76].
        * **Diagram Interpretation (Page 31):** The function $f(n)$ (actual time) is shown to be always on or below $cg(n)$ (upper bound) for $n \ge n_0$[cite: 75].

    * **Big-Omega Notation ($\Omega$):**
        * Defines the **lower bound** of an algorithm's running time; it represents the **best-case time complexity** or the minimum time required[cite: 77, 78].
        * Definition: $f(n) = \Omega(g(n))$ if there exist positive constants $c$ and $n_0$ such that $0 \le cg(n) \le f(n)$ for all $n \ge n_0$[cite: 79]. This means $f(n)$ grows at least as fast as $g(n)$ beyond $n_0$[cite: 79, 80].
        * **Diagram Interpretation (Page 33):** The function $f(n)$ is shown to be always on or above $cg(n)$ (lower bound) for $n \ge n_0$[cite: 79].

    * **Big-Theta Notation ($\Theta$):**
        * Provides a **tight bound**, enclosing the function from both above and below[cite: 81]. Used for analyzing the **average-case complexity** of an algorithm[cite: 82].
        * Definition: $f(n) = \Theta(g(n))$ if there exist positive constants $c_1$, $c_2$, and $n_0$ such that $0 \le c_1g(n) \le f(n) \le c_2g(n)$ for all $n \ge n_0$[cite: 83]. This means $f(n)$ grows at the same rate as $g(n)$ beyond $n_0$[cite: 83, 84].
        * **Diagram Interpretation (Page 35):** The function $f(n)$ is "sandwiched" between $c_1g(n)$ (lower bound) and $c_2g(n)$ (upper bound) for $n \ge n_0$[cite: 83].

## 6. Amortized Analysis

* **Why is it needed?**
    * Classical analysis (best, worst, average case) looks at single operations or assumes inputs don't affect each other's run times[cite: 86, 87, 88, 89, 90].
    * Amortized analysis is used when the cost of one operation in a sequence can affect the cost of subsequent operations[cite: 93, 94, 95].
    * It's useful when an algorithm has occasional slow operations, but most are fast[cite: 98].
* **What is it?**
    * Analysis for a *series* of operations, considering the interplay between them[cite: 97].
    * It guarantees a worst-case *average time* per operation over a sequence, which can be lower than the worst-case time of a single particularly expensive operation[cite: 99].
    * It ensures the average performance of each operation in the worst case, without involving probability (unlike average-case analysis)[cite: 100, 101].
* **Common Techniques:** Aggregate Analysis, Accounting Method, Potential Method[cite: 102].

* **Amortized Complexity vs. Average-Case Analysis** [cite: 130]
    * **Average-Case Analysis:** Considers the probability of different inputs occurring and calculates an expected running time. It relies on assumptions about the distribution of inputs.
    * **Amortized Analysis:** Does *not* involve probability[cite: 100]. It analyzes a sequence of operations and guarantees the average performance per operation in the worst case for that sequence[cite: 101]. Even if some operations in the sequence are very costly, the average cost over the sequence is bounded.

## 7. Deterministic vs. Non-Deterministic Algorithms

* **Deterministic Algorithm:**
    * Given a particular input, it will always produce the same output and pass through the same sequence of states[cite: 103, 104, 111].
    * Its path of execution is the same every time for the same input[cite: 112].
    * Considered reliable due to consistent output for a given input[cite: 113].
    * The outcome is not dependent on the way instructions get executed[cite: 114].
    * Typically takes polynomial time for execution[cite: 115].
    * A deterministic machine's next state is solely determined by its current state and input[cite: 105, 106, 107, 108]. It can still run forever and not produce a result[cite: 109].

* **Non-Deterministic Algorithm:**
    * For the same input, it can exhibit different behaviors and produce different outputs on different runs[cite: 116, 117].
    * The result is not uniquely defined; it could be random[cite: 117].
    * It can arrive at outcomes using various "routes" or choices[cite: 120, 121]. Some paths may lead to the same output, others to unique outputs[cite: 121].
    * Often used to find approximations when exact solutions are too costly with deterministic algorithms[cite: 119].
    * Can run in polynomial or exponential time depending on choices made[cite: 118].
    * **What makes an algorithm non-deterministic?** [cite: 123, 124, 125, 126]
        * Use of external state beyond input (e.g., user input, random values, timer)[cite: 123].
        * Timing-sensitive operations (e.g., multiple processors writing to shared data concurrently)[cite: 124].
        * Hardware errors causing unexpected state changes[cite: 126].

* **Complexity Classes:**
    * **Class P:** Problems solvable in polynomial time with a *deterministic* algorithm[cite: 127]. These are generally considered tractable[cite: 128].
    * **Class NP:** Problems solvable in polynomial time with a *non-deterministic* algorithm[cite: 127]. These are also tractable if non-deterministic algorithms can be used[cite: 128].

## 8. Why We Go for Worst-Case Analysis (e.g., Big-O) [cite: 130]

The document primarily defines Big-O as representing worst-case complexity[cite: 74]. While it doesn't explicitly state *why* this is often preferred over other analyses (the prompt asks "Why we go for worst case analysis of algorithm" [cite: 130]), here are common reasons inferred from general Computer Science knowledge:
* **Guarantee:** Worst-case analysis provides an upper bound on the running time. This means the algorithm will *never* take longer than this bound, which is a crucial guarantee for critical applications.
* **Simplicity:** Average-case analysis can be complex as it requires knowing the probability distribution of inputs, which is often hard to determine accurately. Best-case is often not representative of typical performance.
* **Practicality:** For many algorithms, the worst-case scenario occurs reasonably often, or the inputs leading to it are not easily avoidable.
* **Resource Allocation:** Knowing the upper limit helps in planning and allocating resources (CPU time, memory).
